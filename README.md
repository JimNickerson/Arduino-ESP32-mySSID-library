# Arduino-ESP32-mySSID-library
Save SSID and password in a private library

This is "mySSID.h".
It is intended to be in a library, used to avoid typing in your local SSID and password over and over in each ino.
You only #include <mySSID.h> in your ino or if you installed the library Sketch, include library, mySSID .
Your SSID and password from this mySSID.h file will be used.
You can zip your ino directory without giving away your SSID and password

On first use after installing the library from the zip edit the mySSID.h file with your SSID and password.
